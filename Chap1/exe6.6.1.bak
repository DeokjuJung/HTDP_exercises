;; Data Analysis & Definitions:
(define-struct time (hours minutes seconds))

;; A time is a structure: (make-time h m s) where h, m, and s are numbers.

;; Contract: time->seconds : time -> number

;; to get the number of seconds since midnight

;; Examples:
;; (time->seconds (make-time 12 30 2))
;; =
;; 45002

;; Template:
;; (define (time->seconds a-time)
;; ... (time-hours a-time) ...
;; ... (time-minutes a-time) ...
;; ... (time-seconds a-time) ...)

;; Definition:
(define (time->seconds a-time)
  (+ (* (time-hours a-time) 3600) (* (time-minutes a-time) 60) (time-seconds a-time)))

;; Tests:
(time->seconds (make-time 12 30 2))
;; expected value:
45002
